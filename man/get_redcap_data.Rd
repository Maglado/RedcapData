get_redcap_data(api, token, content = "record", local = TRUE,
  forms = NULL, fields = NULL, ids_to_pull = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{api}{the REDCap instance's api location. Just append /api/ to the instance's url.}

\item{token}{The secret token for the project. Check the API page in REDCap. Must have api rights to access this.}

\item{content}{What to pull. Currently only "record" and "metadata" are supported.}

\item{local}{Whether the REDCap instance is local.}

\item{forms}{a character vector of the list of form data to pull.}

\item{fields}{a character vector of the specific fields to pull.}

\item{ids_to_pull}{a character vector of the specific record itentifiers to pull.}

\description{
Download data from a REDCap repository using the REDCap api in bulk.
}
\details{
A simulation of the posting of a form to the api is done and a connection is obtained.

The connection is then used to read the data into REDCap.

This is done in bulk. In the case  of network latency or big data \code{\link{get_chunked_redcap_data}} would be a better alternative.
